SimpleCalculator
================

This is a GUI based calculator created using python and QTDesigner

This app uses:

+Python 3.4.2
+QT5
 -QTDesigner
 
With these I made a simple calculator of which I abused one of the most awesome programming functions I have come in contact with eval() !!!
 
 I feel like it is bad etiquette to use this function, but hey, this is an amazing function that can be made safe.
 
 There is a minor bug with the "Previous" function, and I will attend to this if I remember to.
